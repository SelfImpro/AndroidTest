# 入门测试

Writing and running tests are important parts of the Android app development cycle. Well-written tests can help you catch bugs early in development and give you confidence in your code. Using Android Studio, you can run local unit tests or instrumented tests on a variety of physical or virtual Android devices. You can then analyze the results and make changes to your code without leaving the development environment.
